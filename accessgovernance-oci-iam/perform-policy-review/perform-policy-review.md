# Create and Perform Policy Review Campaigns

## Introduction

Access Governance Campaign Reviewer (Harlan Bullard) can create policy review campaign and Perform Policy Review tasks. 

* Estimated Time: 15 minutes
* Persona: Campaign Reviewer

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Examine policy review tasks raised by the campaign
* Evaluate policy review tasks assigned to you as a Campaign Reviewer


## Task 1: Perform Policy Review Tasks

  In this task, you will review and certify OCI IAM review tasks raised by the campaign created in the previous task.

  1. On the Oracle Access Governance Console home page, from the navigation menu, select **Access Reviews -> My Access Reviews.** 


  2. To view review tasks created by your policy review campaign, click the **Policy review tasks** tab. You will see all policy access review tasks assigned to you as a reviewer. Oracle Access Governance uses in-house analytic-based Intelligence system to provide accept/review recommendations.

  3. For this tutorial, let’s check the recommendations given by Oracle Access Governance. 

   - network-admins-policy is marked for Review
   - security-admins-policy is marked for Review
   - auditors-policy is marked to Accept


  4. Let’s check out the Insights generated by Oracle Access Governance. For **auditors-policy**, click the corresponding **Actions** links under the **Insights** column.



  5. On the **Insights** page, you can view our recommendation for the policy review task. On the left-panel, you can view the policy information. On the right, you can view a complete list of actionable and non actionable policy statements, view policy details to see who and what the policy statement is granting access to, and make appropriate decisions on each statement.

  7. To make a review decision, you can either revoke all or accept all actionable statements in that policy at once, or make decision individually on each policy statement. For this tutorial, let us validate 2 usecases:

    **Usecase 1:**  Revoke policy statement from a policy - **auditors-policy**

      - Let’s revoke the policy statement **Allow group Auditors to read audit-events in compartment Quality-Assurance** from the policy  **auditors-policy**. 

      ![Access Governance Homepage](images/auditor-policy.png)

      - Click on the cross button under Actions column for the policy statement **Allow group Auditors to read audit-events in compartment Quality-Assurance**

      - Click on **Apply**

      ![Access Governance Homepage](images/click-apply-auditor-policy.png)

      -  Enter justification for why you revoke the access review items and accept the remaining items then click on **Submit** This will trigger the auto-remediation process in the Oracle Access Governance system.

    **Usecase 2:**  Revoke an entire policy - **security-admins-policy** 

      - Let's revoke the entire policy **security-admins-policy** 

       ![Access Governance Homepage](images/security-policy.png)

      - Click on the Revoke All button. 

       ![Access Governance Homepage](images/revoke-all-security-policy.png)

      - Click **Apply.** The **Confirmation** dialog box is displayed.

     - Provide justification and then click **Submit.** The closed loop access remediation will take place automatically.

  7. Login to the Identity domain: ag-domain OCI console as the Identity Domain Administrator. Naviagte to Identity & Security -> Identity -> Policies.

  * Verify the entire policy - **security-admins-policy** has been revoked from the list of policies successfully. 

   Before performing the policy review:
