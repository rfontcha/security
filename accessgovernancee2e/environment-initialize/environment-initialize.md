# Verify environment and initialize 

## Introduction

In this lab we will review the environment setup and start all services required to successfully run this workshop.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 15 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.
[Environment intialize](videohub:1_9mdts598)

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
 * Verify the docker 
 * Start OIG services
 * Verify the status of all servers
 * Verify the private IP address of the compute instance 

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A valid Oracle OCI tenancy, with OCI administrator privileges. 

    *Note:* From this lab onwards until the completetion of the workshop, all the steps need to be performed inside the Workshop URL only. 


## Task 1: Validate Docker is up and running

1. Open a terminal session. 

   ![Open terminal](images/open-terminal.png)

   The terminal session has started. 

   ![Terminal window](images/terminal-window.png)

2. Check the version of the docker.

    ```
    <copy>docker -v</copy>
    ```
    ![Check the version of docker](images/docker-version.png)

    ```
    Expected output: Docker version 23.0.0, build e92dd87
    ```
    

3. Validate the status to verify if docker service is up/running

    ```
    <copy>systemctl status docker</copy>
    ```

    ![Validate the status of docker](images/docker-info.png) 

     Enter **Ctrl+C** to return to the command prompt

## Task 2: Start the Oracle Identity Governance (OIG) Services

1. Move to the directory where the script files are located.
     
    ```
    <copy>cd /scratch/idmqa/scripts</copy>
    ```

    ![Move to script files location](images/script-file.png)

2. List the files inside the directory.

    ```
    <copy>ls</copy>
    ```

    ![List of files in directory](images/list-files.png)


3. Start DB and all servers manually,using below scripts.

    ```
    <copy>./start_db.sh</copy>
    ```
    Wait till DB gets started. Then proceed to start all servers.

    ![DB server started](images/start-db.png)

    ![DB server started](images/db-started.png)

    ```   
    <copy>./start_all_servers.sh</copy>
    ```

    ![All servers are started](images/start-all-servers.png)

## Task 3: Verify the Private IP address of Compute Instance

1. Launch a browser window. Login to OCI console using the URL mentioned below. The OCI account sign in page appears. Enter the username and password provided during signup.
    
    ```
    <copy>https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/</copy>
    ```

2. Click the Navigation Menu icon in the top left corner to display the *Navigation menu.* Select *Compute* in the *Navigation menu*. Select *Instances* from the list of products.
     
    ![Move to script files location](images/oci-console.png)
    ![List of files in directory](images/compute-instance.png)


2. Notedown the Private IP address of the Compute Instance for reference. We will require to use them in the further labs. 

      ![List of files in directory](images/private-ip.png)

 

    You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
