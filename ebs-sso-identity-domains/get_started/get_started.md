## Introduction

Oracle Cloud is the industry's broadest and most integrated cloud provider, with deployment options ranging from the public cloud to your data center. Oracle Cloud offers best-in-class services across Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Types of Cloud Accounts

We offer two types of Cloud Accounts:

*Free Tier Accounts*:  After you sign up for the free [Oracle Cloud promotion](https://signup.cloud.oracle.com) or sign up for a paid account, you will get a welcome email. The email provides you with your cloud account details and sign in credentials.

*Oracle Cloud Paid Accounts*:  When your tenancy is provisioned, Oracle sends an email to the default administrator at your company with the sign-in credentials and URL. This administrator can then create a user for each person who needs access to the Oracle Cloud. Check your email or contact your administrator for your credentials and account name.
