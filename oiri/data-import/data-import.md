# Import data into OIRI from Oracle Identity Governance

## Introduction

Data import, also called data ingestion, is the process of importing entity data from a source to the Oracle Identity Role Intelligence (OIRI) database. OIRI uses a data ingestion command-line tool (DING CLI) to fetch and load entity data from third-party sources, namely Oracle Identity Governance (OIG) database or flat files.
As part of the data import process, data from the source, such as OIG database or flat files, is loaded into the following tables of the OIRI database:
`USERS`, `APPLICATIONS`, `ACCOUNTS`, `ENTITLEMENTS`, `ASSIGNED_ENTS`, `ROLES`, `ROLE_USER_MSHIP`, `ROLE_ENT_COMPOSI`, `ROLE_HIERARCHY`, `ORGANIZATIONS`.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Configure Data Import from Oracle Identity Governance Database
* Perform a dry data import run
* Perform an actual data import run to extract the entity data from the OIG database and load it to the OIRI database tables
* Verify and review the data import process

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Prepare Setup (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Environment Setup
    - Lab: Initialize Environment
    - Lab: Deploy Kubernetes Cluster and Start OIG Server
    - Lab: Deploy OIRI in the local Kubernetes Node

## Task 1: Starting the data load process

1. Copy ca.crt from K8S Master.

    ```
    <copy>cp /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt /nfs/ding/</copy>
    ```

2. Run ding-cli container and update the existing data load configuration to import entity data from Oracle Identity Governance database.

    ```
    <copy>docker exec -it ding-cli bash</copy>
    ```
    ```
    <copy>./updateDataIngestionConfig.sh --useoigdbforetl true --entityusersenabled true --entityuserssyncmode full --entityapplicationsenabled true --entityapplicationssyncmode full --useflatfileforetl false</copy>
    ```

## Task 2: Perform a Dry Import Run

1. Before data import (or data ingestion), perform a dry run to validate if the data fits into the OIRI database. This will fetch data from Oracle Identity Governance database and validate it against the metadata of the OIRI database.

    ```
    <copy>ding-cli --config=/app/data/conf/config.yaml data-ingestion dry-run /app/data/conf/data-ingestion-config.yaml</copy>
    ```

2. The Dry Data Import process takes about 8-10 minutes. While the process is running, we can observe the pods that get generated under the namespace ding by running the following command in another terminal tab.

    ```
    <copy>kubectl get pods -n ding</copy>
    ```

    Notice that once the dry-run task has completed, the ding driver will move from the status *Running* to *Completed*.


3. Sign in to the OIRI console and monitor the data import process as shown in the steps below.

## Task 3: Sign in to the OIRI user interface and validate the dry data import

1. Sign in to Identity Role Intelligence user interface. Launch a browser window and enter the URL mentioned below. Ignore the warning message by clicking on *Advanced* and then on *Accept Risk and Continue. The OIRI account sign in page appears. Enter the username and password.

    ```
    URL       https://oiri.livelabs.oraclevcn.com:30305/oiri/ui/v1/console/
    Username  xelsysadm
    Password  Welcome1
    ```

2. Click the Application Navigation menu icon on the top left of the page, and click *Data Import* to open the *Manage Data Import* page with a list of all the data import tasks.

    ![Click Data Import to open the Manage Data Import page](images/manage-data-import.png)    


3. While the dry-run is running, observe that there is a red clock icon next to the task. Once the dry data import run has been completed successfully, we will get a green tick and the button *View Results* will be made available. Click *View Results* against the Import data(dry-run) from Oracle Identity Governance task. Alternatively, you can click the data import task name. The *View Results* window is displayed with the result for data import from Oracle Identity Governance database.

4. Expand each entity to review the details of the data import of that entity, such as duplicate data count, whether or not dataset is valid, and the count of invalid data type.

    ![View Results - User](images/user-data-import.png)

5. Click Cancel to close the View Results window.

## Task 4: Data Import from Oracle Identity Governance

1. Run the actual data import process.

    ```
    <copy>ding-cli --config=/app/data/conf/config.yaml data-ingestion start /app/data/conf/data-ingestion-config.yaml</copy>
    ```

2. The Data Import process takes about 8-10 minutes. While the process is running, we can observe the pods that get generated under the namespace ding by running the following command in another terminal tab.

    ```
    <copy>kubectl get pods -n ding</copy>
    ```

    ![Terminal command to observe the pods that get generated under the namespace ding](images/getpods-data-import.png)

    Notice that once the dry-run task has completed, the ding driver will move from the status *Running* to *Completed*.

## Task 5: Validate the data import task

1. Access the OIRI console from the browser window.

2. Click the Application Navigation menu icon on the top left of the page, and click *Data Import* to open the Manage Data Import page with a list of all the data import tasks

3. While the data import is running, observe that there is a red clock icon next to the task. Once the data import run has been completed successfully, we will get a green tick and the button *View Results* will be made available. Click *View Results* against the Import data from Oracle Identity Governance task. Alternatively, you can click the data import task name. The *View Results* window is displayed with the result for data import from Oracle Identity Governance database.

4. Expand each entity to review the details of the data import of that entity.
