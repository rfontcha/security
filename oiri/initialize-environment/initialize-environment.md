# Initialize Environment

## Introduction

In this lab we will review and startup all components required to successfully run this workshop.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 20 minutes

### About Product/Technology
Oracle Identity Role Intelligence(OIRI) is a powerful and flexible enterprise identity management system that automatically manages user's access privileges within enterprise IT resources.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Initialize the workshop environment.
* Verify the database Status.
* Verify the status of 12c Domain.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Prepare Setup (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Environment Setup

*Note: If you have a **Free Trial** account, when your Free Trial expires your account will be converted to an **Always Free** account. You will not be able to conduct Free Tier workshops unless the Always Free environment is available. **[Click here for the Free Tier FAQ page.](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/faq.html)***


## Task 1: Validate That Required Processes are Up and Running.
1. Now with access to your remote desktop session, proceed as indicated below to validate your environment before you start executing the subsequent labs. The following Processes should be up and running:

    - Database Listener
    - Database Server
    - Admin Server (Admin server will take about 3-4 mins to start)

2. On the *Web Browser* window on the right preloaded Weblogic 12c console, click on the *Username* field and select the saved credentials to login. These credentials have been saved within *Web Browser* and are provided below for reference.

    ```
    Username  weblogic
    Password  Welcome1
    ```

    ![Weblogic console login page](images/oiri-vnc.png " ")

3. Confirm successful login. Please note that it takes about 5 minutes after instance provisioning for all processes to fully start.
    - On the Weblogic console, Click on *Servers* under *Environment* and verify that the Admin server is in the ‘RUNNING’ state.
    ![Click on servers under Environment](images/oiri-landing.png " ")

    If successful, the page above is displayed and as a result your environment is now ready.  

    You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).

4. If you are still unable to login or the login page is not functioning after reloading from the URL mentioned below, open a terminal  session and proceed as indicated below to validate the services.

       ```
      URL       http://oiri.livelabs.oraclevcn.com:7001/console/login/
      Username  weblogic
      Password  Welcome1
       ```
      

    - Database and Listener

      ```
      <copy>
      sudo systemctl status oracle-database
      </copy>
      ```
      ![Terminal window command to validate database status](images/db.png " ")

    - WLS Admin Server And Node Manager

      ```
      <copy>
      sudo systemctl status oiri-weblogic.service
      </copy>
      ```
      ![Terminal window command to validate WLS Admin Server status](images/oiri-wls-service.png " ")

      ```
      <copy>
      sudo systemctl status oiri-node.service
      </copy>
      ```
      ![Terminal window command to validate Node Manager status](images/oiri-node-service.png " ")

5. If you see questionable output(s), failure or down component(s), restart the corresponding service(s) accordingly

    - Database and Listener

      ```
      <copy>
      sudo systemctl restart oracle-database
      </copy>
      ```

    - WLS Admin Server And Node Manager

      ```
      <copy>
      sudo systemctl restart oiri-weblogic.service
      </copy>
      ```
      ```
      <copy>
      sudo systemctl restart oiri-node.service
      </copy>
      ```

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
