# Assess Database Users

## Introduction

User Assessment helps you assess the security of your database users and identify potential high risk users. By default, Oracle Data Safe automatically generates user assessments for your target databases and stores them in the Assessment History. You can analyze assessment data across all your target databases and for each target database. You can monitor security drift on your target databases by comparing the latest assessment to a baseline or to another assessment.

In this lab, you explore User Assessment.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- View the dashboard for User Assessment
- Analyze users in the latest user assessment
- Review the `ADMIN` user's audit records
- Generate suspicious activity on the target database
- Refresh the latest user assessment and rename it
- View the user assessment history for your target database
- Compare the latest user assessment with the initial user assessment
- Download the latest user assessment as a PDF report
- View the user assessment history for all target databases


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- Obtained an Oracle Cloud account and signed in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console
- Prepared your environment for this workshop (see [Prepare Your Environment](?lab=prepare-environment))
- Registered your target database with Oracle Data Safe (see [Register an Autonomous Database with Oracle Data Safe](?lab=register-autonomous-database))
- Started audit data collection for your target database in Oracle Data Safe (see [Audit Database Activity](?lab=audit-database-activity)). Audit data collection is required if you want to view users' audit records from within User Assessment.


### Assumptions

- Your data values might be different than those shown in the screenshots.


## Task 1: View the dashboard for User Assessment

1. Navigate to **User Assessment**. To do this, in the breadcrumb at the top of the page, click **Security Center**. On the left, click **User Assessment**.

2. Under **List Scope**, make sure your compartment is selected. Deselect **Include child compartments**.

3. At the top of the dashboard, review the four charts.

    - The **Potential User Risk** chart shows you the number and percentage of users who are potentially **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, and **Low** risk.
    - The **User Roles** chart shows you the number of users with the **DBA**, **DV Admin**, and **Audit Admin** roles.
    - The **Last Password Change** chart shows you the number of users who changed their passwords within the last 30 days, within the last 30-90 days, and 90 days ago or more.
    - The **Last Login** chart shows you the number of users that signed in to the target database within the last 24 hours, within the last week, within the current month, within the current year, and a year ago or more.

4. Review the **Risk Summary** tab.

    - The **Risk Summary** tab focuses on potential risks across all selected target databases. It shows you potential risk levels, the number of target databases, the number of users at each risk level, and counts for DBAs, DV Admins, and Audit Admins.
    - Potential risk levels are categorized as **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, and **Low**.

    ![User Assessment Risk Summary tab](images/ua-risk-summary-tab.png "User Assessment Risk Summary tab")

5. Click the **Target Summary** tab. This tab provides the following information:

    - Number of critical and high risk users, DBAs, DV Admins, and Audit Admins
    - Date and time of the latest user assessment
    - Whether the latest user assessment deviates from the baseline (if one is set)
