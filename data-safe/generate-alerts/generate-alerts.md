# Generate Alerts

## Introduction

An alert is a message that notifies you when a particular audit event happens on a target database. In Oracle Data Safe, you can provision alert policies on your target databases, view and manage alerts, view predefined alert reports, and create custom alert reports.

Start by reviewing the predefined alert policies in Oracle Data Safe, and then provision two of them. Using Database Actions, perform activity on your target database to cause alerts in Oracle Data Safe. Review the generated alerts and create a custom alerts report. Download the report as a PDF.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Review the Oracle Data Safe alert policies
- Provision alert policies on your target database
- Perform activity on your target database to generate alerts in Oracle Data Safe
- Review alerts in Oracle Data Safe
- View details for an alert and close it
- Create a custom alerts report
- Generate and download a custom alerts report as a PDF
- View the alert report history

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- Obtained an Oracle Cloud account and signed in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
- Prepared your environment for this workshop (see [Prepare Your Environment](?lab=prepare-environment))
- Registered your target database with Oracle Data Safe. Make sure to have the `ADMIN` password for your target database on hand (see [Register an Autonomous Database with Oracle Data Safe](?lab=register-autonomous-database)).
- Started audit data collection for your target database in Oracle Data Safe (see [Audit Database Activity](?lab=audit-database-activity))


### Assumptions

- Your data values are most likely different than those shown in the screenshots.

## Task 1: Review the Oracle Data Safe alert policies

1. In **Security Center**, click **Alerts**.

    The **Alerts** page is displayed. The alerts dashboard does not have any data because you have not yet enabled any alert policies.

    ![Alerts dashboard without data](images/alerts-dashboard-no-data.png "Alerts dashboard without data")

2. Under **Related Resources**, click **Alert Policies**.

3. Review the list of available alert policies provided by Oracle Data Safe. They are as follows:

    - Failed Logins by Admin User
    - Profile Changes
    - Database Parameter Changes
    - Audit Policy Changes
    - User Creation/Modification
    - User Entitlement Changes   
    - Database Schema Changes
   

    ![Oracle Data Safe alert policies](images/oracle-data-safe-alert-policies.png "Oracle Data Safe alert policies")

4. Click the **User Creation/Modification** alert policy and review its details.

    The **Alert Policy Details** page is displayed for the **User Creation/Modification** alert policy.

    ![User Creation Modification alert policy details](images/user-creation-modification-alert-policy-details.png "User Creation Modification alert policy details")

5. Next to **Policy Applied On Target Databases**, click **View List** to view the target databases associated with the alert policy.

    The **Target-Policy Associations** page is displayed with the **Policy Name** filter set to **User Creation/Modification**.
    Because you have not yet associated the alert policy with any target database, the table shows **No Target-Policy Associations Available**.

    ![No Target-Policy Associations Available](images/no-target-policy-associations.png "No Target-Policy Associations Available")


## Task 2: Provision alert policies on your target database

1. From the **Policy Name** drop-down list under **Filters**, select **All**.

2. On the **Target-Policy Associations** page, click **Apply Policy**.

    The **Apply And Enable Alert Policy To Target Databases** panel is displayed.

3. Select **Selected Targets Only**.

4. If needed, click **Change Compartment** and select your compartment.

5. From the drop-down list, select your target database.

6. Select **Selected Policies Only**.

7. From the drop-down list, one at a time, select the **User Creation/Modification** and **Failed Logins by Admin User** alert policies.

8. Click **Apply Policy** and wait until a message states that you can close the panel.

    ![Apply and Enable Alert Policy To Target Databases dialog box](images/apply-and-enable-alert-policy-dialog-box.png "Apply and Enable Alert Policy To Target Databases dialog box")


9. Click **Close**.

    The two target-policy associations for your target database are listed on the page and are enabled and active. If a target-policy association is not displayed, please clear the filter for the policy name if it's still set to **User Creation/Modification**.

    ![Two target-policy associations for your target database](images/two-target-policy-associations-for-target.png "Two target-policy associations for your target database")


## Task 3: Perform activity on your target database to generate alerts in Oracle Data Safe

In this task, you perform activities on your target database in Database Actions to generate some audit data. First, purposely try to log in as the `ADMIN` user with incorrect passwords. Then, sign in and create a user account.

1. Return to the SQL worksheet in Database Actions.

2. From the drop-down list in the upper-right corner, select **Sign Out**. If needed, in the dialog box, click **Leave page**.

3. Click **Sign in**.

4. Enter `ADMIN` for the username, and then click **Next**.

5. Do this twice: Enter an incorrect password, and then click **Sign in**. The message **An invalid user name or password was supplied.**

    ![Invalid database password message](images/invalid-database-password.png "Invalid database password message")

6. Enter the correct password, and click **Sign in**.

7. Clear the worksheet, and then paste the following SQL script:

    ```
    <copy>drop user MALFOY cascade;
    create user MALFOY identified by Oracle123_Oracle123;
    grant PDB_DBA to MALFOY;</copy>
    ```

8. On the toolbar, click the **Run Script** button and wait for the script to finish running.

    ![Run Script button](images/run-script.png "Run Script button")

9. Return to the browser tab for Oracle Data Safe and wait a couple of minutes for Oracle Data Safe to produce the alerts.


## Task 4: Review alerts in Oracle Data Safe

1. Under **Security Center** on the left, click **Alerts**.

2. Under **Filters** on the left, select your target database.
